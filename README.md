# 🧪103.8 Lab: Basic File Editing 

## ✅ What I did in this lab
I used the vi editor to navigate a text file, switch between modes, insert and delete text, and perform useful commands like search, copy, and paste. I also checked out other editors like nano and emacs, and learned how to configure the default system editor.

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

🔹Delete a character — move cursor and press:

🔹Delete a full line

🔹Undo your last action

🔹Copy one line (yank)

🔹Paste below the current line

🔹Paste above the current line

## 5️⃣ Searching Inside the File
🔹Search for a word in the file

Forward: /word

Backward: ?word

Navigate results: n (next), N (previous)

## 6️⃣ Saving and Exiting the File
🔹Save and exit

🔹Save only

🔹Quit without saving

## 7️⃣ Trying Other Editors
🔹Create/edit the same file in nano

🔹Edit using emacs

## 8️⃣ Set the Default Editor
🔹Temporarily set nano as the default editor

🔹Make it permanent (add to shell config)

## 🧠 What I Learned
In this lab, I learned how to effectively navigate and edit files using vi, which is essential for any Linux system administrator. I practiced switching between modes, using keyboard commands to edit and move text, and even discovered how to change the default text editor system-wide. This gave me confidence in managing files directly from the command line without relying on graphical interfaces. 💪🖥️
