# 🧪103.8 Lab: Basic File Editing 

## ✅ What I did in this lab
I used the vi editor to navigate a text file, switch between modes, insert and delete text, and perform useful commands like search, copy, and paste. I also checked out other editors like nano and emacs, and learned how to configure the default system editor.

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 🧠 What I Learned
In this lab, I learned how to effectively navigate and edit files using vi, which is essential for any Linux system administrator. I practiced switching between modes, using keyboard commands to edit and move text, and even discovered how to change the default text editor system-wide. This gave me confidence in managing files directly from the command line without relying on graphical interfaces. 💪🖥️
