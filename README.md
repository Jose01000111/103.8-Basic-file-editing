# ðŸ§ª103.8 Lab: Basic File Editing 

## âœ… What I did in this lab
I used the vi editor to navigate a text file, switch between modes, insert and delete text, and perform useful commands like search, copy, and paste. I also checked out other editors like nano and emacs, and learned how to configure the default system editor.
